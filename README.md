## PlantDiseaseHD API
This is an application that employs a custom machine learning model, utilizing a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to identify plant diseases through images. 
The model has been trained with a public dataset from Kaggle.

### Prerequisites
You need to have the following tools installed globally on you machine:
    * Python
    * Docker

### Installation

Because there is limit of 100MB from github, we need to install the model from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iqv0P2JLC9I1X6UJFwCeDKf1DU8kEAZv/view?usp=drive_link) with the name plant_disease_model.h5 within ./app/.
